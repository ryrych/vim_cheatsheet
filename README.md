How can I swap split window position?

```
+---------+---------+           +---------+---------+
|         |         |           |         |         |
|         |         |           |         |         |
|         |         |           |         |         |
|         |         |           |         |         |
|   B     |    A    | +------>  |   A     |    B    |
|         | (here)  |           |         |         |
|         |         |           |         |         |
|         |         |           |         |         |

```

```
Ctrl-w-J
```

More info:
- You can use any direction key (**capital**) to change position: `h`, `j`, `k`, `l`
- Use `Ctrl-w-r` to **rotate** windows.


I'm at the end of the screen. How can I have more context without switching to
normal mode and pressing `zz`?

Use `zz` in **insert normal** mode, `Ctrl-o zz`.
